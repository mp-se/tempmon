# Temperature Monitor for Beer Brewing

This is a software derived from GravityMon which only support a device with a temperature sensor attached. So all gyro related features are not available.

This is an experimental build, based on a user request.

# Limitations 

A lot of the documentation for gravitymon is valid for this software but with the following limitations:

* Configuration mode is only activated when the device is charging (battery over 4.15V)
* No customization of format templates (using fixed formats)

Let me know if this is of interest and I can fix some documentation for this project.
